## Bathymetry

There are a couple of seamounts outside the EEZ (called Schmidt-Ott and Erica) that we should be able to reach, if of interest.  Seamounts will have a bunch of stuff living on top of them and could have upwelling of deep nutrients up their sides.

In the map below, the pinkish-red shaded area shows the EEZ (200 nm from the coast) within which we cannot do any sampling.

## Expected conditions

The pink points on each plot are the stations from the potential route at the bottom of the page, except for the one furthest west, which was the originally planned mooring location.

### Reanalysis model forecasts

The following plots are forecasts for 3<sup>rd</sup> February 2023, which is as far ahead as is currently available.

## Possible route

An example route taking 4 days of transit (thus leaving 48 hours for science):

![Four-day transit route](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mvdh7/64PE513/main/figures/4day_transit.png)

  - It would probably be more sensible to go in the opposite shown so we can put out the mooring first (station 4).
  - Station 3 is over the "Erica" seamount.
  - Station 2 hits the Agulhas retroflection thus switching to Indian Ocean waters.  There's a filament of high productivity (see chlorophyll, NPP and phytoplankton plots) at the boundary where (from looking at the nutrient maps) the limiting nutrient switches from iron to phosphate.  Might be very interesting to sample the boundary plus points either side.
  - Station 1 could probably be brought a lot closer to the line between 2 and Cape Town to save time - we'd save ~6 hours of transit time by skipping it completely.

Disadvantage of the route: we don't return to any location twice, so couldn't deploy floating sediment traps.  But I think that recovering these under time pressure is quite risky - need to discuss with someone more experienced if these are of serious interest.

Of the 48 hours of science we'd spend ~4 hours deploying the mooring plus a 4-hour deep CTD at that location.  That leaves 40 hours for other things.  If we did a full-depth CTD at each station (4 hours) plus deep (4 hours) and shallow (2 hours) multinet plus ring net (1 hour?) then we'd have 7 hours to spare.  For the water chemistry, I'd be content with a shallow (1000 m) CTD which would take only ~1 hour instead of ~4, but then we can't do a monocore.
